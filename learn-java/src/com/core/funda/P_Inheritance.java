/* Why to Use Inheritance ?
 * 	Ans : Suppose take Student personal info and Employee info as two modules, who will have common properties
 * 			So, writing same thing again and again, is wastage of memory , increasing cost and time of project
 * 			So, Create a class by taking properties of already existing class
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *INHERITANCE:  It is a process of creating new class by taking the properties of already existing class
 * 
 * In simple words inheritance is nothing but VERSIONIZATION
 *		
 *		Eg: Windows 7 , Windows 10 - not eliminating all features of old version rather adding new feature to existed feature
 *			i.e versionization
 *		Eg: I am specialized, my father is generalized why ?
 *				I(Subclass) inherited from my father(superclass) 
 *				All properties of father i can enjoy, including my earning
 *				My self can use my gather/ my bike - specialized
 *
 *ADVANTAGES : Code reusability, Code optimization, Memory optimization, Reducing the cost and time of project
 
 
 *A class which is inheriting is called Super class or generalized class
 
 
 *A class which is inherited is known as Sub class or Specialized class
 
 
 *SUB CLASS is having rich set of properties than super class
 
 
 *If you create an object for the super class we can access the properties of only super class
 
 
 *Similarly if you can create an object for the subclass we can access the properties of both super class and sub class
 
 
 *AS PER THE OOPS INHERITANCE IS CLASSIFIED INTO 2 TYPES/ Categories
 
 *	1. Single Inheritance
 *	2. Multiple Inheritance
 
  		By the combination of Single&Multiple inheritance we have the following comnination
  *			3. Multilevel Inheritance
  *			4. Hierarchical Inheritance
  *			5. Hybrid Inheritance (Multilevel + Multiple)
  *			6. Multipath Inheritance (Hierarchical + Multiple)
  
  * Note: Java doesn't support Multiple Inheritance?
  * 		JAva doesn't support multiple inheritance and its related combinations using classes
  * 		BUT ALL THE TYPES OF INHERITANCES ARE POSSIBLE IN JAVA USING INTERFACES
  * 
  * Single Inheritance : Creating sub class taking properties of a super class
  * 
  * Multiple Inheritance: Creating sub class taking properties of more than one super class
  * 
  * 	THe combination of both single and multiple inheritance, we have following forms
  * 
  * Multilevel Inheritance: Creating sub class taking properties of super class and Creating another sub class
  * 
  * Hierarchical Inheritance: Creating more than one sub class by taking Properties of super class
  * 
  * Hybrid Inheritance (Multilevel + Multiple) : Creating sub class by taking properties of more than one super class
  * 
  * Multipath Inheritance (Hierarchical + Multiple) : Combination of both Hierarchical + Multiple
  * 
  * 			NOTE:
  * 					IN order to access the properties of one class to another class then the corresponding classes
  * 					should have some relation between them
  * 
  * 					In JAva TWO types of relationship
  * 
  * 						1. has-a relationship
  * 						2. is-a relationship
  *
